Basically just swap in the files in this archive to the appropriate locations under your codeigniter installation, and access it via the your_domain.com/tools/form_builder url

You can see a running copy of this at http://www.bottledsanity.com/tools/form_builder

Codeigniter can be found here: http://codeigniter.com/

My method of programming has a master template that is used to wrap around most pages.  This makes it easier for me to design a site.
I have included a primative template in the views folder named template.php.  Removing the template portions should not be hard.

Under the views folder is a folder named form_builder.  This folder contains the views needed for the form generation process.
in views/form_builder/templates there are sub folders, in each sub folder you can put a variant of the four files used for generating form items.

files:
application/controllers/tools.php - the controller that handles the form builder
application/views/form_builder/
	form_builder.php - the master generation form
	form_builder_single_item.php - used to render the sample items for the form to give you an idea of whats on your form

application/views/form_builder/templates/*
	submit_button.php - the submit button that is placed on the html form
	form_builder_item.php - the html code that is rendered
	form_builder_javascript.php - the javascript code that is rendered
	form_builder_php.php - the php code that is rendered
	template_name.txt - the name of this variant of the template, used on the template picker on the main generate tab

assets/css/jquery-ui.css - the jquery-ui css file used for the jquery-ui code
assets/css/images - images used for jquery-ui.css

js/array_functions.js - a couple array functions needed for the process including one from http://phpjs.org/functions/serialize
js/form_builder.js - functions for running the form builder
js/form_builder_functions.js - functions for running the form builder (could be combined with form_builder.js
js/plugins.js - the cookie function from http://plugins.jquery.com/files/issues/jjquery.cookie-modified.js_.txt  -- needed for CSRF fix

-----------

Added functionality to import a mysql table.

Just fill in the database fields at the bottom of the form and click "import table"
Fill in the form name and action and then process the form and it should automagically generate the files needed based
on the table format.
